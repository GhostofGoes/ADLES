# *** Syntax inspirations ***
# Docker Compose file:  https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
# Ansible Playbooks:    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html

# *** Labels for syntactic components ***
# Children do not have to be specified if parent is not defined
# If no label is given, then context will determine label (Everything should be labeled eventually)
#
# REQUIRED      These must be defined. Not doing so is an parse-time error.
# Suggested     These should be defined. Not doing so will result in a parse-time warning.
# Optional      Do not have to be specified.
# Option X      One of the options specified at that level of nesting must be defined. Not doing so is a parse-time error.

# *** Definitions ***
# VM    Virtual Machine
# AD    Active Directory
# CIDR  Classless Inter-Domain Routing, a concise format for representing subnet masks (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632)
# YAML  Yaml Ain't Markup Language, a file format syntax (http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/)
# JSON  JavaScript Object Notation, a file format syntax (http://www.json.org/)

# *** Notes ***
# "Instances" is assumed to be one unless specified otherwise. They cannot be negative or zero
# Top-level definitions are only required if used (e.g resources, groups, networks)
# Details on exercise environment creation steps ("phases") can be found in the description for folders
# "yes"/"no" are the same as true/false in YAML. They can be used interchangably.


# ** Document Metadata **
metadata:
  name: "name"                # Suggested   Human-readable title for the specification [default: filename]
  description: "description"  # Suggested   Human-readable detailed description of the specification
  activity: "the activity"    # Optional    The activity the specification is being used for, e.g "CS 439" or "PRCCDC"
  prefix: "GLOBAL-PREFIX"     # REQUIRED    Globally unique prefix that distinguishes this exercise's environments from others on the same infrastructure
  date-created: "date"        # Optional    UTC format: YYYY-MM-DD (Example: 2016-10-12)
  version: "0.0.0"            # Suggested   Semantic version of the document: major.minor.bugfix (Refer to: http://semver.org/)
  infrastructure-config-file: "filename.yaml" # REQUIRED    YAML file specifying the infrastructure used to create the exercise environment (See: infrastructure-specification.yaml for syntax)
  folder-name: "/Path/To/Folder-Name"         # Suggested   Path of the folder that will contain the exercise, relative to root defined in the infrastructure configuration


# ** Groups/Teams **
# User groups, such as teams, students, instructors, etc
# These are used to apply permissions to the resources and machines in the generated virtual exercise environment
groups:
  Group Regular Example:
    # The three different methods of specifying users for a regular group
    ad-group: "Users"       # Option A  AD group must exist
    filename: "a-file.json" # Option B  File format: specifications/user-json-specification.json
    user-list: [ "user-a", "user-b" ] # Option C  List of usernames

  # For creating batch groups from a common template base, the "template" type can be used
  Group Template Example:
    instances: 10           # REQUIRED  Number of groups created from this template. This marks a group as a template.
    ad-group: "Group [X]"   # Option A  '[X]' is the instance number. AD group must exist  
    filename: "users.json"  # Option B  File format: specifications/user-json-specification.json

# Case insensitive EXCEPT for resources, such as templates or images
# Networks are attached to interfaces in order of their definition, unless explicitly mapped

  resource-p:
    lab: "power-lab"          # REQUIRED    Name of the lab the resource is associated with
    resource: "transformer"   # REQUIRED    Name of the specific resource


# ** Networks **
# Definitions of virtual networks (Layers 2 and 3 of the OSI model)
# Non-Private (RFC 1918) networks will result in a warning
